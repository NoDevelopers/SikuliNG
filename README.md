SikuliX Version 2
============

**Version 2.0.0 under developement (pre-alpha!)** (not useable yet, massive redesign planned)

**[Read about the latest ready to use SikuliX1](http://sikulix.com)**

<hr>

**Forking and/or downloading this repo only makes sense:**

 - if you want to get a knowledge about the internals of SikuliX
 - if you want to create your own packages containing SikuliX features
 - if you want to contribute (what currently does not really make sense)

For use with Java aware scripting and Java programming you might need additional stuff and steps at your own resposibility. 

<hr>

**BE AWARE: Java 8+ required** 

Development on latest Java<br>
Source code level and byte code level are both 1.8

**Issues and pull requests are only accepted here on Github, but currently ignored**

<hr>

**Redesign goal**

Implement the API completely as a REST-API backed by a server running on the target machine.

This will allow many more client implementations even in a browser context.

For backward compatibility the SikuliX1 API will be reimplemented based on this REST-API.
