SikuliX Version 2 - Java API
============

**Version 2.0.0 under developement** 

**[Download](http://sikulix.com) latest ready to use version 1.1.x** [or get the Sources](https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX1)

<hr>

Travis CI (Ubuntu 12.04-64, Java 9, xvfb)
<br>Developing and testing locally with Java 9 on macOS 10.13 and Windows 10
<br>using [JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
<br>Translation project: [Transifex::SikuliX2](https://www.transifex.com/sikulix/sikulix2/dashboard/)
<br>Documentation project: [ReadTheDocs::SikuliX2](http://sikulix2.readthedocs.org/) based on [GitHub::SikuliX2-Docs](https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX2-Docs)

**Forking and/or downloading this repo only makes sense:**

 - if you want to get a knowledge about the internals of SikuliX
 - if you want to create your own packages containing SikuliX features
 - if you want to contribute.

For use with Java aware scripting and Java programming you might need additional stuff and steps at your own resposibility.

**BE AWARE: Java 8 or Java 9 required** 

I am developing on Java 9<br>
Source code level and byte code level are both 1.8

 - the new public features are in **com.sikulix.api**
 - the current API (up to 1.1.x) in **org.sikuli.script** will be kept for backwards compatibility, but rerouted to **com.sikulix.api/core** as needed
 - new projects using Java should use the API as provided by **com.sikulix.api**

Prerequisites for development and testing
---

 - a Java JDK 1.8
 - Maven 3+
 - only 64-Bit Systems supported

**For developement I use the [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com)**

 - **[IntelliJ IDEA CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)** for Java and everything else
 - **[PyCharm CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)** for special Jython/Python stuff
 - **[RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/)** for special JRuby/Ruby stuff (special license for OpenSource projects)
 
Be aware for development and testing

 - the so called folder `SikulixAppData`, where SikuliX specific stuff is stored once per machine, for SikuliX2 now is `SikulixAppData/SX2` to allow the parallel usage of SikuliX1 and SikuliX2 on the same machine.
